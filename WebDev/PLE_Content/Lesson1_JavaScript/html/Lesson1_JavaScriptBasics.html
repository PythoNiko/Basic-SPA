<p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, 
	can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, 
	the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.</p>
	
<p>JavaScript is incredibly versatile. You can start small, with carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, 
	and responses to button clicks. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, 
	comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>
	
<p>JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core 
	JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) â€” APIs built into web browsers, providing functionality like dynamically 
		creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
    <li>Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
    <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because this article is only supposed to be a light introduction to JavaScript, we are not going to confuse you at this stage by talking in 
	detail about what the difference is between the core JavaScript language and the different tools listed above. You can learn all that in detail later on.</p>
	
<p>Next, we will introduce you some aspects of the core language, and you'll also play with a few browser API features too. Click on the "Hello World" button and have fun!</p>
