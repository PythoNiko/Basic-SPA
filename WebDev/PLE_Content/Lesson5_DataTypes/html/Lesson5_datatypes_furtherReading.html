<h4>String Data Type</h4>

<p>A string value is a chain of zero or more Unicode characters (letters, digits, and punctuation marks). 
	You use the string data type to represent text in JavaScript. You include string literals in your scripts by enclosing 
	them in single or double quotation marks. Double quotation marks can be contained in strings surrounded by single quotation marks, 
	and single quotation marks can be contained in strings surrounded by double quotation marks.</p>
	
<p>To represent a single character in JavaScript, you create a string that consists of only one character. A string that contains zero 
characters ("") is an empty (zero-length) string.</p>
	
<h4>Number Data Type</h4>

<p>In JavaScript, there is no distinction between integer and floating-point values; a JavaScript number can be either (internally, 
	JavaScript represents all numbers as floating-point values).</p>
	
<p><u>-- Integer Values</u></p>
	
<p>Integer values can be positive whole numbers, negative whole numbers, and 0. They can be represented in base 10 (decimal), 
	base 16 (hexadecimal), and base 8 (octal). Most numbers in JavaScript are written in decimal.</p>
	
<p>You denote hexadecimal ("hex") integers by prefixing them with a leading "0x" (zero and x|X). They can contain digits 0 through 9, 
	and letters A through F (either uppercase or lowercase) only. The letters A through F are used to represent, as single digits, 
	10 through 15 in base 10. That is, 0xF is equivalent to 15, and 0x10 is equivalent to 16.</p>
	
<p>You denote octal integers by prefixing them with a leading "0" (zero). They can contain digits 0 through 7 only. A number that has a leading "0" 
	and contains the digits "8" and/or "9" is interpreted as a decimal number. Both hexadecimal and octal numbers can be negative, but they cannot 
	have a decimal portion, and they cannot be written in scientific (exponential) notation.</p>
	
<p><u>-- Floating-point Values</u></p>

<p>Floating-point values can be whole numbers with a decimal portion. Additionally, they can be expressed in scientific notation. That is, an uppercase 
	or lowercase "e" is used to represent "ten to the power of". JavaScript represents numbers using the eight byte IEEE 754 floating-point standard for 
	numerical representation. This means you can write numbers as large as 1.79769x10308, and as small as 5x10-324. A number that contains a decimal point 
	and that has a single "0" before the decimal point is interpreted as a decimal floating-point number.</p>
	
<h4>Boolean Data Type</h4>

<p>Whereas the string and number data types can have a virtually unlimited number of different values, the Boolean data type can only have two. They are the 
	literals true and false. A Boolean value is a truth-value: it specifies whether the condition is true or not.</p>
	
<p>Comparisons you make in your scripts always have a Boolean outcome. Consider the following line of JavaScript code:</p>

<p><i>y = (x == 2000);</i></p>

<p>Here, the value of the variable x is compared to the number 2000. If it is, the result of the comparison is the Boolean value true, which is assigned to the variable 
	y. If x is not equal to 2000, then the result of the comparison is the Boolean value false.</p>
