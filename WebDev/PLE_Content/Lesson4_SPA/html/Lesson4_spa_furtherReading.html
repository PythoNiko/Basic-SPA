<h4>Finding the Right Framework for You</h4>

<p>There are ongoing flame wars online about which is the best framework for building apps. Indeed, each has its own strengths and weaknesses, 
	which we will not get into in this chapter. They all, however, have one thing in common: JavaScript.</p>
	
<p>And that’s what we recommend: Learn JavaScript and its modern ecosystem well. Adopt Node.js, even for your client-side development, 
	as it will bring a lot of good tooling to help bundle your code, run linters to avoid common syntax mistakes, run unit tests, and more. 
	Once you’ve adopted Node.js, be sure to bring all your dependencies in through NPM, including your CSS dependencies, such as Font Awesome, 
	Twitter Bootstrap, etc. Adopt ES2015 (also known as ES6) and all its latest features through Babel, which transpiles ES6 code back to ES5 
	JavaScript code that browsers can understand, since they haven’t been fully upgraded to support the latest features of JavaScript yet. Also, 
	if you are a fan of strict typed languages, then be sure to look into Flow and/or TypeScript.</p>
	
<p>Once you’ve gotten a hang of tooling and the JavaScript ecosystem, and have identified which parts you like the most, pick a framework that fits your 
	choice. Ultimately, the each framework’s goal is the same: building an awesome app. So it will be up to you to figure out if you want, for example, 
	a more object-oriented or a more functional approach when building apps.</p>
	
<p>You’ll also have to decide how much control you want over your application’s architecture. If you want to make most of the architecture decisions yourself, 
	then you might be more interested in bringing different libraries together, which is more compatible with how React works. But if you prefer to have most 
	decisions made for you, and you’re okay with giving up a bit of flexibility, then maybe Angular or Ember will be the best choice, as they both provide more 
	opinionated ways of writing your app right out of the box.</p>
	
<p>Ultimately, there is no wrong or right answer when choosing your JavaScript framework and tooling of choice, so it is up to you to figure out what works best in your situation, 
	depending on your level of experience, how much flexibility your job provides, how much code is already written, and other factors.</p>
