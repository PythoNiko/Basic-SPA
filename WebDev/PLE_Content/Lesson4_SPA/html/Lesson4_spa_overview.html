<h4>Single-page Applications</h4>

<p>The term “single-page application” (or SPA) is usually used to describe applications that were built for the web. 
	These applications are accessed via a web browser like other websites, but offer more dynamic 
	interactions resembling native mobile and desktop apps.</p>
	
<p>The most notable difference between a regular website and an SPA is the reduced amount of page refreshes. 
	SPAs have a heavier usage of AJAX — a way to communicate with back-end servers without doing a full page refresh — to get data 
	loaded into our application. As a result, the process of rendering pages happens mostly on the client-side.</p>
	
<p>While building SPAs is trendy and considered a modern development practice, it’s important to be aware of its cons, including:</p>
	
<ul>
	<li>The browser does most of the heavy lifting, which means performance can be a problem — especially on less capable mobile devices.</li>
	<li>Careful thought must be put into search engine optimization (SEO) so your content can be discoverable by search engines 
		and social media websites that provide a link preview.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Mitigating Cons With Server-side Rendering</h4>

<p>Most modern JavaScript frameworks are working on ways to handle server-side rendering of SPAs — meaning the user 
	would get a fully populated page when the SPA is loaded for the first time, instead of, for example, seeing a loading indicator.</p>
	
<p>Server-side rendering can alleviate some of the burden browsers have to go through when rendering pages, 
	and will also help with the problem of SEO and content discoverability.</p>
	
<h4>Popular JavaScript Frameworks for Building SPAs</h4>

<p>The more interactivity that happens on the client-side, the more JavaScript code is needed to make those interactive pieces function well. 
	And the more code is written, the more important it is to have a clean and well-architected codebase. And this is exactly the problem JavaScript 
	frameworks help solve — each with its own approach. There are a lot of open source JavaScript frameworks that help with building SPAs, such as:</p>
	
<ul>
	<li>Angular</li>
	<li>React</li>
	<li>Ember</li>
	<li>Aurelia</li>
	<li>Backbone</li>
</ul>
