<h4>What is Markup?</h4>

<p>XML is a markup language that defines set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. 
	So what exactly is a markup language? Markup is information added to a document that enhances its meaning in certain ways, in that it 
	identifies the parts and how they relate to each other. More specifically, a markup language is a set of symbols that can be placed in 
	the text of a document to demarcate and label the parts of that document.</p>

<h4>Is XML a Programming Language?</h4>

<p>A programming language consists of grammar rules and its own vocabulary which is used to create computer programs. These programs instruct 
	the computer to perform specific tasks. XML does not qualify to be a programming language as it does not perform any computation or algorithms. 
	It is usually stored in a simple text file and is processed by special software that is capable of interpreting XML.</p>
